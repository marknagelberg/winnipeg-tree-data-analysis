# Winnipeg Open Data Tree Data Analysis

This Jupyter notebook provides a data analysis of tree data available on the
City of Winnipeg website.

To run the notebook yourself, you'll need to add two files to the main
directory:
- [Map_of_Tree_Inventory.csv](https://data.winnipeg.ca/api/views/hfwk-jp4h/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD)
- [Census 2006 - Neighbourhood Boundary.geojson](https://data.winnipeg.ca/api/geospatial/k78r-tn6e?method=export&format=GeoJSON)

Have a look at the blog post related to this analysis [here](http://www.marknagelberg.com/adventures-in-op%E2%80%A6nnipeg-tree-data/)
